# TimeCode Converter

This is a very simple website made to convert between television timecode (commonly used at broadcasting companies such as the BBC and ITV) and real time.

I used this as a basic intro into JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and it consists of only a basic frontend with 3 text fields used for converting between timecode and real time, based on the inputs of current time/framecount, framerate, and time offset (in the case that a recording starts at 10:00:00:00 for example, as it does in some shows and movies).

The website can be accessed at this url: https://justin-everett.github.io/timecodeconverter/
